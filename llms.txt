Project: arcdps_exporter
Date: 2025-08-08

This is an extremely barebones arcdps plugin written in Rust using the arcdps crate.

Key files:
- Cargo.toml: Contains project metadata and dependencies
- src/lib.rs: Contains the plugin implementation using arcdps::arcdps_export! macro
- .gitignore: Standard Rust project gitignore
- llms.txt: This file - contains project context and memory

Build process:
- The project is configured to build as a cdylib (DLL)
- Use "cargo build --release" to build the plugin
- Output is in target/release/libarcdps_exporter.so (or .dll on Windows)
- The DLL can be renamed to .dll for Windows compatibility

Plugin functionality:
- Uses the raw_combat callback to receive combat events
- Currently just prints a message when combat events occur or when initialized
- Uses the arcdps::arcdps_export! macro to define the plugin
- The plugin signature (sig) is set to 0x12345678 - this should be changed to a unique value
- The callback function signature must match exactly what arcdps expects:
  - unsafe extern "C" fn with specific parameter types
  - Parameters: ev, src, dst, skill_name, id, revision

Dependencies:
- arcdps = "0.11.2" - provides the arcdps plugin bindings

Development history:
- Created new Rust project with cargo
- Added arcdps dependency
- Configured as cdylib in Cargo.toml
- Implemented basic plugin using arcdps::arcdps_export! macro
- Fixed callback signature issues
- Successfully built the DLL

Next steps:
- Add actual plugin functionality
- Implement additional callbacks if needed (imgui, options, etc.)
- Test with actual arcdps environment
- Consider adding configuration options
- Implement proper error handling

Technical details:
- The arcdps::arcdps_export! macro generates the necessary boilerplate
- The raw_combat callback receives combat events from arcdps
- The plugin can access various game data through the arcdps API
- Memory safety is handled by Rust's ownership system

Common issues and solutions:
- Callback signature mismatch: Ensure the function signature exactly matches what arcdps expects
- Macro usage: Use arcdps::arcdps_export! not just arcdps_export!
- DLL naming: On Linux, the output is .so, on Windows it should be .dll

Useful commands:
- cargo build --release: Build the plugin in release mode
- cargo check: Quickly check for compilation errors
- cargo doc --open: Open the documentation

Notes:
- The plugin is currently very minimal and doesn't do much beyond basic initialization
- For a real plugin, you'd want to add actual functionality like:
  - Combat logging
  - UI elements
  - Data analysis
  - Integration with other systems
- Remember to change the plugin signature to a unique value
- Consider adding proper error handling and logging
